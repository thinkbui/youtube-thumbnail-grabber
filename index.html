    <h1>YouTube Thumbnail Grabber</h1>
  </header>
  <article>
    <p>This is a crude utility I've built to easily download YouTube video thumbnails.  This is meant for my own purposes, but you're welcome to use it yourself.</p>
    <p>Once you enter in the video's ID in the form below and submit it, the thumbnails will appear in the tables below.  You can click on any of them to view in a new browser tab or select them using the checkboxes.  The latter will populate the text box at the very bottom with download commands you can run from the command line.</p>
    <p>NOTE: The download commands are intended to be run through a command line such as bash or Windows Command Prompt.  You will also need to have cURL installed in order to run these commands (All modern systems I've worked with have it by default).</p>
    <p>NOTE: This is just for grabbing the thumbnails for things like blog posts and archival purposes.  If you wish to download the videos themselves, there are plenty of options you can find by Googling for them.</p>

    <h2>YouTube ID</h2>
    <p>Enter the video's YouTube Id in the text box below.  You can easily find it in the video's URL (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=[ID HERE]&t=XXXX or https://youtu.be/[ID HERE]?t=XXXX)</p>
    <p>If you need more help, this <a href="https://commentpicker.com/youtube-video-id.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comment Picker utility</a> is very useful.  Integrating something similar on this page is planned for the future.</p>
