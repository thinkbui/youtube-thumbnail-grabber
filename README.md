# youtube-thumbnail-grabber

## SUMMARY
This is a crude utility I've built to easily download YouTube video thumbnails. This is meant for my own purposes, but you're welcome to use it yourself.

## INSTRUCTIONS
This is built entirely for the front end, so you can either browse to the deployed page or download this repository and open in your browser locally.

When you enter the YouTube video's ID in the form and submit, the tables below will populate with that video's thumbnails.  You can either click on these thumbnails to view in a new tab or select them using the checkboxes to generate download commands that can be run from the command line.  These commands will appear in the text box at the very bottom of the page.

## NOTES
The download commands will save the thumbnails with "YouTube" and the video's ID as prefixes.  There are no plans to change this or make them user-editable.

## LIVE VIEW
You can view the live app [here](https://thinkbui.github.io/youtube-thumbnail-grabber/).
